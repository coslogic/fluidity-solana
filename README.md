# fluidity-solana

Fluidity solana implementation. Implements a "factory" for distributing
fluid tokens.

## Building

	make build

Ensure that solana environment is correctly set up.

## Deploy

	make deploy

Ensure that solana environment is correctly set up.

## Wrap(amount, token\_name, bump\_seed)

Wrap an amount of one token into the equivalent amount of its fluid
analog. Requires the name of the token to be provided in upper case,
as well as the bump seed of the program's derived obligation authority
account for that token.
